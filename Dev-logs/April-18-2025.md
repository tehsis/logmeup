Cursor made a decent job at initializing the project (after being generated by create-react-router).
I have asked it to use _langchain_ for interacting with the LLMs. Took me a while to make it work with structured outputs and JSONOutputParser. It might be related that I'm using a local (8b) llama3 version. Results are not great but for a PoC works just fine. I'm pretty sure that a more powerful model might yield better results.
I will polish the app a bit before moving to that.

My next step will be to extract and manage configuration via Pulumi.
