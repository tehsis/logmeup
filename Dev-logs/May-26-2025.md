Might seems obvious but old habits die hard.
I should start working on Product Requirement Documents than then I can feed into cursor for building the features I need.

At this point the app is in good shape for personal use. That is, anyone that knows how to host something like this, can do it and use it... and should work (that's how I'm using it right now) but of course this is not very convenient.
I'm debating myself wether add more features _I need_ vs make it accesible but I will go with the latter. 

I will start adding authentication so users can log in and have their own notes and actions accesible at all times.
