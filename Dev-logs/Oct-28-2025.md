it has been a while since the last time I've updated these logs (or worked on this project for what is worth).
The app is at a point where I can start using it. I mean. It has notes and todo lists, right? 
At this point covers what I already do with Apple Notes and Microsoft TODO list. Although I need to being able to access it anywhere. So next step of course is to deploy it _to the cloud_.
Although it might be an overkill for the app, I'll deploy it using K8S... most likely on AWS EKS. Of course I'll use pulumi for it.
First of all, I'll just configure the app in a k8s cluster running on minikube. I'll leave postgres and ollama as third-party services (so for running this project, you'll have to have them running elsewhere)
The service running by default will use the same config than running it local.
