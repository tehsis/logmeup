Keeping the log up to date along with the used prompts is a habit that I need to build / improve.

The app is now working locally as an offline first app, but in order to be a _useful_ note taking app it needs to be multi-device ready, meaning that it needs to sync in the cloud.

For this I've built a rest-api using go (available at logmeup-api) which offers a simple api (without any sort of authentication at this point) that will be used for this matter.

The app should still work offline. Eventually I might expect it can support other clients or maybe using third party app (eg, notion for note taking and Microsoft TODO for actions management) but for now I feel there's better flexibility on owning both sides.
